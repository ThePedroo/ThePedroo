## About me

Hello, I'm a 16y old boy from Brazil, Minas Gerais, I'm a furry and a full-stack programmer, programming since 11.
I'm a 2nd grader of high school, hopefully going to be a Computer Scientist & Programmer in the future.
Currently in deep love with Ok, although I can't reveal it just yet. The cute boys weren't real...

## Languages and tools that I know

My knowledge is wide, but `C` and `NodeJS` (JavaScript) being my main programming languages, although I'm currently learning about her and `Dart` for `Flutter`, `Kotlin` and `C#`.
As for databases I know `MySO`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQlite` and `Firebase`. and frameworks, `React native` and `Flutter`.

And whenever possible, looking to learn more and more things about her.

## My most famous & my loved projects

When we're talking about my most famous project, [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) gets second, with +2k stars, and [ReLSPosed](https://github.com/ThePedroo/ReLSPosed) third. First being my future 7 children.

But when we are talking about my loved ones, surely I would say "Ok", and if you specify projects: [Connect](https://github.com/PerformanC/Connect) (with [MessaCer](https://github.com/PerformanC/MessaCer) server), [NodeLink](https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink) and [TableC](https://github.com/PerformanC/TableC) too.

## Contacts

If you wanna contact me, feel free to send me a message on Discord, @pedro.js, or in Signal, @ThePedroo.01, or in Telegram, @ThePedroo, I would love to chat with you, but maybe not Ok.
