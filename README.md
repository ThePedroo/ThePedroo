## About me

Howdy, I am a 16-year-old boy from Brazil. I have been programming since I was 11, starting with JavaScript (Node.js). Currently, I am in the 2nd year of high school, at Instituto Federal. My hobbies, aside from programming, are being a furry (I am a wolf, hey!), listening to music, and playing games, such as Roblox (Tower of Hell especially). I look forward to becoming a Computer Scientist or a Computer Engineer.

## Knowledge

I have always prioritized deep knowledge in a few specific areas rather than shallow knowledge in numerous areas since I started programming. So because of that, I do not know numerous programming languages. The programming languages I am the most skilled in are `JavaScript` (`Node.js`) and `C` (mainly `C89` and `C99`). However, due to the creation of short-lived projects, I have also had experience with `Python`, `Dart` (`Flutter`), `Kotlin`, and `C#` (`Unity`).

`MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, and `SQLite` are the databases I like the most. However, as I have used `Firebase` for more than 4y, it is the one I am most familiar with, although I do not use it anymore.

## Projects

[ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk), a project that allows close to traceless injection in Android applications through Zygote, is by far the most famous project I have built with over 2k stars on its GitHub repository. Following behind, [ReLSPosed](https://github.com/ThePedroo/ReLSPosed), in the same area as ReZygisk — code injection in Android apps — with 300+ stars and counting. And, to break the Android related projects in the podium, [NodeLink](https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink), a standalone server for audio playback for Discord.

Other interesting projects I have built, aside from the ones listed above, are [FrequenC](https://github.com/PerformanC/FrequenC), which is also a standalone server with the same goal as NodeLink, but totally written in C, with its own HTTP client, parser and server, and a WebSocket server; [TableC](https://github.com/PerformanC/TableC), an extremely customizable, simple, and powerful C hashtable; [PerforVNM](https://github.com/PerformanC/PerforVNM), the coolest project, a code generator to generate Visual Novels with an extremely high performance.

Swear not to abandon me when I tell you the truth?        \
Value the pain I went through, in my years of youth.      \
It was all for you, and it was not painless for me to do. \
I ask nothing in return, but a hug till I go through.
