## About me

Hello, I'm a 15y old boy from Brazil, Minas Gerais, I'm a furry and a full-stack programmer, programming since 11.
I'm a 1st grader of high school, hopefully going to be a Computer Scientist & Programmer in the future.

## Languages and tools that I know

My knowledge is wide, but being `C` and `NodeJS` (JavaScript) my main programming languages, although I'm currently learning `Dart` for `Flutter`, `Kotlin` and `C#`.
As for databases I know `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQlite` and `Firebase`. and frameworks, `React native` and `Flutter`

And whenever possible, looking to learn more and more things.

## My most famous & favorite projects

When we're talking about my most famous project, [TableC](https://github.com/PerformanC/TableC) wins, with +20 stars, and [Coglink](https://github.com/PerformanC/Coglink) being the second.

But when we are talking about my favorite ones, surely I would say: [Connect](https://github.com/PerformanC/Connect) (with [MessaCer](https://github.com/PerformanC/MessaCer) server), [NodeLink](https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink) and [TableC](https://github.com/PerformanC/TableC) too.

Obviously all of them are from PerformanC, since all of them are focused on that consequently, and with better API designs than the ones in my profile.
